- Should i generate barcodes from fastq files or use the pseudo ones ? 

- log.txt from imngs analysis shows a very high percentage of sequences not merged due to > 5 diffs. Is this normal ? 

- Current sequences contain a barcode of 10 or 12 bases ? 

- Is trimming referring to sequences with or without barcodes ?
